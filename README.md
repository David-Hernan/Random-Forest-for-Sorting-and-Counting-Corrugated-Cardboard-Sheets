# Random-Forest-for-Sorting-and-Counting-Corrugated-Cardboard-Sheets
The present work consists of the implementation of a Random Forest for the classification and accounting of corrugated cardboard sheets of type B, BC, C, E and EB. For this, the basic knowledge necessary to understand the work is explained in the theoretical framework, especially those related to the types of flutes, to later explain the composition of the implemented Random Forest code, as well as the results of it.

Note: The datasets for flutes B, BC, C, E, and EB are not in the repository for confidentiality reasons.
